# Artifact Helper

A helper for Valve's Artifact draft mode that displays an overlay on individual cards showing stats gathered from [Artibuff](https://www.artibuff.com/), tier lists (default tier list is Hyped's from [DrawTwo](https://drawtwo.gg/hypeds-limited-tier-list)), prices and custom annotations.

## Installing

Download latest [release](https://github.com/eoakley/artifacthelper/releases/latest).

Run the Artifact Helper executable file and follow the instructions.


### Prerequisites

* **Windows only**

* **Artifact running on borderless window or windowed mode**

* **If you are using [Windows scale options](https://imgur.com/a/exmJC79) (zooms text, apps, icons), you need to disable it by right clicking the Artifact Helper shortcut -> Compatibility tab -> [Change high DPI settings](https://imgur.com/a/ljvFDWU) -> check High DPI scaling override and select Application**

### **Optional** - Running from source

If you have Python 3, you can run Artifact Helper pretty easily.

1. Install requirements by running "pip install -r requirements.txt".

2. Run on terminal "python artifact_helper.py"

It is also possible to build your own installation (.exe file) if you are an adventurer. Instructions are on file "How to build.txt".

## How to use

After installation, simply launch the program via the start menu shortcut whenever you are going to draft.

When you are on a draft card selection screen click the "Launch Overlay" button and then switch back to your game.

If the program has properly loaded you will notice the Artifact Helper banner on top of the game. (remember that it won't work unless it is on **borderless window** or **windowed** mode).

Whenever you want to see the stats of the cards on display just click the "Scan Cards". After you finished the draft close the overlay window (click on the X on the top-right corner).

If you have problems, try the 'Customize Grid' option.

## How does it work

Uses a hash heuristic to match images via brute force.

Using tier lists and historic data, we can show each card's win rate, pick rate and tier.

We built an interface using [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) to create the overlay on top of the game.

Artifact Helper was built with Python 3.6.5 and is distributed via a self contained environment (built with [Pynsist](https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist)).

Tested only on Windows 10.
